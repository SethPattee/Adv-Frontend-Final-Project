**Adv-Frontend-Final-Project**

1. An elevator pitch of your project (something you can say in less than 1 minute)
    - I want to make a site that allows you to see the stars of when you were born, have a blog that you can post, upload images of the sky, create and edit a profile, and connect with friends. It will be more of a way for people to connect with others, with a hock for people to get to the site and connect.
2. The names of the contributors (if you are working with a partner)\
    - Just me
3. A rough list of features (this needs to be large enough to satisfy the "scope" requirements)
    - See the stars of when you were born, have a blog that you can post, upload images of the sky, create and edit a profile, and connect with friends.
4. A list of new things you will need to do to accomplish your project (e.g. websockets)
    - Astronomy API
    - OAuth
    - Rich Text Editor
    - Image Uploads
    - Friend System?
    - Infinite Scroll or Pagination
    - Push Notifications
    - API/Database depending on my framework
